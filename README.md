This is a Java Project made through JavaFx packages
It is an Auction System where only the owner knows the password.
In this project, the password is 'password'
Here,the database is setup on the localhost - mysql,where a table named auction is created.
The columns of the table being the item-primarykey,present price and past price and these values being updated on the go.

To use this project, you will necessarily need the eclipse IDE.
You will need to create a build path to the user libraries for the sql connector.
You will need to create a path to the user defined library - to the lib file of javafx jdk and load all the files.
The following are youtube links to set up the editor:

How it Executes?
The owner logs in through his access-credentials and adds the initial bidding amount for each of the different item types.
Then the users can start bidding. If the user cannot afford more,he quits
And the final bidding amount is stored in the database.The user who manages to make the purchase can navigate to home and later pay by scanning the QR Code.
The Customer is required to walk into the store with the paid acknowledgement to collect the product.

I had fun learning JavaFX. Hope you all enjoy coding!
To understand this code,start debugging from the Main function.
Have a look at the screen shots of the application as well.
